# consulting_analysis

You are a financial analyst with a national consulting firm. Your firm regularly sets up contracts with companies all over the country to improve their business model. The firm currently does not have a headquarters and mostly utilizes work from home employees due to the needed flexibility of traveling. Currently the board of directors is investigating the formation of a headquarters location to add visibility to the firm and grow in an area they are most likely to succeed in.

You have been given two data files: customers.csv and contracts.csv.

The customers file contains details about your current customers, their locations contact info and markets they do business in. The contracts file shows all of the contracts created in 2019. Using this data, you will need to investigate where the majority of your customers are located, where the most profitable areas are, and any other insights you may find to be helpful in deciding on the right location to establish a headquarters.

The 2020 preliminary data should be available soon as well, so you will want to use Python to create a standard way to analyze the data, allowing you to reuse it quickly when 2020 values are available.
